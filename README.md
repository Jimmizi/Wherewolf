Welcome to Where wolf?, a procedural murder mystery game set in the victorian town of Wildpelt. You've been called in as a detective to question the townsfolk and track down the big bad werewolf running havok in the town.

Use your wits, the games tools, and maybe some pen and paper if you're really looking to get into it - to correlate the clues given to you. Everyone but the werewolf is trying to help you!

Movement: WASD or Arrow Keys. Mouse for interaction. Tutorial also in-game.
